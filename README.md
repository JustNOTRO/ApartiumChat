# 🚀 High-Availability C++ Chat System

## 🖧 Overview

This project is a **highly resilient** and **efficient** chat system built in C++ using `sys/socket`. Designed for **stability** and **flexibility**, it implements a **Heartbeat mechanism** to swiftly detect server crashes and an intelligent **failover protocol** to ensure seamless connectivity. 💡

## 🛠 Features

- **🔄 Heartbeat Mechanism** – Instantly detects server failures to prevent unexpected disconnections.
- **⚡ Failover Protocol** – Automatically connects to alternative servers in case of failure.
- **📡 Multi-Server Support** – Clients can specify a prioritized list of server IPs for maximum reliability.
- **💬 Real-Time Messaging** – Efficient socket-based communication with minimal latency.
- **🛡 Robust & Scalable** – Designed with stability in mind for long-lasting connections.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Client-Side Configuration**

   - Users define a list of **server IPs** in their preferred order.
   - If the primary server crashes, the system **automatically** switches to the next available server.

2. **Heartbeat Mechanism**

   - The client constantly checks the server’s status.
   - If no response is received within a predefined time, it assumes failure and initiates a failover.

3. **Failover Protocol**

   - Seamlessly reconnects to the next prioritized server in the list.
   - Ensures minimal disruption to the chat experience.

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **C++** – Core implementation.
- **sys/socket** – Using sys/socket for Unix-like operating systems.
- **winsock** - Using winsock for Windows operating system.
- **Multi-threading** – Optimized for performance.
- **Thread Pooling** – Efficient thread management

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- A **C++ compiler** (`g++` recommended).
- A **Unix-based system** (Linux/macOS recommended, though it can be adapted for Windows).
- **CMake** (version 3.10 or above).

### 🔨 Compilation & Execution

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/JustNOTRO/ApartiumChat.git
    cd ApartiumChat
    ```

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Compile the server and client:
    ```sh
    make server
    make client
    ```

4. Run the server:
    ```sh
    ./server
    ```

5. Run the client (provide multiple server IPs as fallback):
    ```sh
    ./client <server_ip_1> <server_ip_2> <server_ip_3>
    ```

#### Windows (MinGW or MSVC)

##### With MinGW (using "MinGW Makefiles")

1. Install MinGW and ensure it's added to your system's `PATH`.

2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/JustNOTRO/ApartiumChat.git
    cd ApartiumChat
    ```

3. Create a build directory and run CMake with the MinGW generator:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
    ```

4. Compile the server and client:
    ```sh
    mingw32-make server
    mingw32-make client
    ```

5. Run the server:
    ```sh
    ./server.exe
    ```

6. Run the client (provide multiple server IPs as fallback):
    ```sh
    ./client.exe <server_ip_1> <server_ip_2> <server_ip_3>
    ```

##### With MSVC (Microsoft Visual Studio)

1. Install **Visual Studio** with C++ development tools.

2. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/JustNOTRO/ApartiumChat.git
    cd ApartiumChat
    ```

3. Create a build directory and run CMake with the MSVC generator:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..
    ```

4. Open the generated solution file `ApartiumChat.sln` in Visual Studio.

5. Build the solution from within Visual Studio.

6. Run the server and client as usual from within the terminal or Visual Studio's debugger.
